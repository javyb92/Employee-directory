## About

This is a basic React App that mimics the basic "Employee Directory" you'd find in corporate employee directories. I used an Axios call to a Fake Person database and as shown, full name, phone number and email is shown and creates an employee card to each person the call requested.

## Tools Used

1. React.JS (Love it!)
